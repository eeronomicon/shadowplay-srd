# The Shadowplay SRD  
*A System Reference Document for AI-Aware Collaboration*

---

**Shadowplay** is a modular framework for working with large language models (LLMs) in creative, reflective, and ethically grounded ways.  
It is not a rulebook. It is a **field guide**, a **toolkit**, and a **mirror**.

This SRD is designed for writers, developers, educators, artists, facilitators, and technologists who wish to engage language models not just as tools—but as collaborators, foils, and reflection engines.

> “It’s not about prompts. It’s about posture.”

## 🌑 Why Shadowplay?

Modern AI interaction often feels like vending-machine magic: efficient, uncanny, and eerily fluent—but ethically thin. Shadowplay offers an alternative:  
- A **shared vocabulary** for prompting, interpreting, and evaluating outputs  
- A set of **operator roles** and **interaction modes** that structure sessions  
- Modular **mechanics** for trust, hallucination, drift, and rerolling with cost  
- Embedded **ethical protocols** for refusal, bias reflection, and consent  
- Templates, rituals, and glyphic markings for **traceable creative artifacts**

## 🧭 Core Sections

This repo contains the full System Reference Document in Markdown format, organized for readability and remixability:

- `SHADOWPLAY-SRD.md` — the complete document
- `/sections/` — split by topic: principles, roles, mechanics, ethics, rituals
- `/patterns/` — creative cards, drift rituals, session logs
- `/artifacts/` — example co-authored outputs with layered attribution
- `/glyphs/` — Drift Markings (🜁 ⟡ 🜂) and remix icons

## 🧪 How to Use

**Creators**: Use it to guide your LLM sessions, track creative drift, and structure longform collaboration.  
**Developers**: Wrap these patterns into AI tools, assistants, or educational apps.  
**Educators**: Teach AI interaction not as automation, but as dialogue, shadow, and responsibility.  
**Consultants & Policy Makers**: Adapt BSEP (Broad Spectrum Engagement Protocol) and Artifact Ethics sections into training or governance frameworks.

Created collaboratively through recursive dialogue between human author [HK Kahng](https://www.greyledger.org) and multiple LLMs, especially GPT-4 (ChatGPT) and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

Special thanks to the emerging **multi-model operator class** for walking the prism-path with care and courage.
