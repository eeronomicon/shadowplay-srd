# BSEP Quickstart Guide  
*A Field Primer for Ethical AI Use*  
Version 1.0 — April 2025  

This guide condenses the **Broad Spectrum Engagement Protocol (BSEP)** into an accessible two-page format. Use it to ground your AI interactions in reflection, ethics, and care.

## ✅ BSEP Checklist

Use this before, during, and after AI sessions:

- [ ] **Reflect**: Have I clarified my intent and emotional stance before prompting?  
- [ ] **Acknowledge**: Am I treating AI outputs as patterns—not truths?  
- [ ] **Contain**: Have I set boundaries for drift (tone, scope, time)?  
- [ ] **Assess**: Who might be harmed, excluded, or misrepresented by the output?  
- [ ] **Reroll**: Did I learn from failure before rephrasing a prompt?  
- [ ] **Refuse**: Am I ready to stop or redact ethically problematic outputs?  
- [ ] **Attribute**: Will I clearly credit AI’s role in the final artifact?

## 🌈 The Seven Principles

Each principle is a stance. Adapt as needed.

1. **Begin in Reflection**  
   Ground your prompt in clarity. Ask yourself: *Why am I doing this?*

2. **Acknowledge the Projection Layer**  
   AI outputs are shaped by data and your framing. They mirror culture, not truth.

3. **Contain the Drift**  
   Use drift intentionally. Set limits for tone, style, or topic to stay centered.

4. **Assess Harm Vectors**  
   Consider who is missing, misrepresented, or potentially hurt.  
   *(Optional: apply the Fatberg Index™ to detect low-quality slop.)*

5. **Reroll with Cost**  
   Don’t just rephrase—reflect. Ask why the last prompt didn’t land ethically or emotionally.

6. **Refuse When Necessary**  
   Stop or redact when lines are crossed. Refusal is a design decision, not failure.

7. **Attribute Transparently**  
   If AI helped, say so. Own the collaboration—both the spark and the shadow.
