# Contributing to the Shadowplay SRD  
*Welcome, Operator. This is not just a repository—it’s a reflection chamber.*

---

We welcome remixers, reformers, skeptics, dreamers, policy wonks, educators, creative technologists, language hackers, and shadowcasters of all kinds.

This document outlines how to contribute responsibly, creatively, and in alignment with the spirit of the **Shadowplay System Reference Document (SRD)**.

## 🌱 Ways to Contribute

You can:

- Propose new **Operator Roles**, **Interaction Modes**, or **Session Mechanics**
- Suggest improvements to **language clarity**, **structure**, or **tone**
- Submit new **Templates, Rituals, or Creative Pattern Cards**
- Translate the SRD into other languages or cultural metaphors
- Add real-world **Session Logs** or **Artifact Examples**
- Fork this repo to create variant frameworks or house rules

You may also raise issues or open discussions for:

- Ethical concerns (e.g., hallucination risks, misuse, cultural context)

- Integration with AI tools, games, or learning environments

## 🪞 Collaboration Principles

Please observe the following principles when contributing:

**1. Be AI-Aware**  
This framework is designed for co-creation *with* language models, not merely about them.  
If AI helped shape your contribution, **disclose the role it played** (see Artifact Ethics).

**2. Prioritize Posture over Perfection**  
Your contributions don’t have to be polished. We welcome notes, fragments, glyphs, and poetic stumbles—if they’re aligned with the spirit of reflection, agency, and ethical engagement.

**3. Annotate Your Shadow**  
If you propose new mechanics, rituals, or roles, briefly describe:
- Where the idea came from (session log, lived practice, other field)
- What Operator Mode it supports (e.g., Weaver, Witness, Catalyst)
- Whether it's inspired by or adapted from another project (cite it if possible)

**4. Don’t Break the Drift**  
Maintain the modular tone of the SRD. Clarity is valued, but so is resonance. Each addition should feel like part of the shadowplay, not a footnote to it.

**5. Embrace Refusal**  
It’s okay to propose things and later retract them. It’s okay to say: *this doesn’t belong.* The Refusal Stack is part of the process.

## 🛠️ How to Submit a Contribution

1. **Fork the repo** and create a new branch:  
   `git checkout -b add-shadow-leakage-event`

2. **Make your changes** in the relevant section or folder (e.g. `/sections`, `/patterns`, `/examples`)

3. **Include Drift Marking and Attribution Notes** where appropriate:
   - 🜁 = Lightly touched by AI  
   - ⟡ = Co-created with model  
   - 🜂 = Model-generated, human curated

4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your addition:
   - What it is  
   - Where it fits in the SRD  
   - Why it might help other Operators

5. Be ready for kind, curious feedback—or gentle refusal.
