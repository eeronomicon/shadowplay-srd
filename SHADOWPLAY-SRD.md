# The Shadowplay SRD
A System Reference Document for Human‚ÄìAI Collaboration in the Age of Language Models  
*Version 0.1 ¬∑ Living Draft*  
Created by HK Kahng and Tutelary Agents in the Drift

## WHY THIS EXISTS
This is a system for people who talk to AI‚Äîand want to stay human while doing it.  
The Shadowplay SRD is not a rulebook. It‚Äôs a *field guide*, *ethical compass*, and *creative toolkit* for those working alongside language models and other generative AI systems. It borrows the structure of TTRPG system reference documents not for gameplay, but for *interaction design*, *ethical framing*, and *discursive clarity* in our increasingly entangled collaborations with machine learning models.

This SRD exists to:  
- Encourage *critical and creative practices* of AI engagement  
- Offer *shared language and mechanics* for prompts, posture, and process  
- Support the development of *ethical, resilient, and transparent* human‚ÄìAI systems  
- Provide a *flexible framework* others can *remix, extend, and ritualize* in their own contexts  

You can build with it, teach from it, push against it, or light a fire with it. *Just don‚Äôt pretend the light has no source.*

## I. CORE PROTOCOLS

### BSEP: The Broad Spectrum Engagement Protocol
**Summary**: The *Broad Spectrum Engagement Protocol (BSEP)* is the foundational ethical posture for working with language models. It is not a checklist. It is a *stance*. A practice of awareness before, during, and after engaging with generative systems.  
The BSEP exists to ensure that interaction with AI remains *human-led*, *context-aware*, and *accountable*‚Äîespecially in the face of fluency, speed, and scale.

**Core Principles of BSEP**:  
- **Begin in Reflection**: Before you prompt, ask: *What do I expect from this exchange? What am I assuming the model understands?* Your intent should be grounded, not impulsive.  
- **Acknowledge the Projection Layer**: Every output is shaped by human data. Every prompt is a shadow cast by your framing. *The AI does not ‚Äúknow.‚Äù It recombines.* Treat the response as *patterned possibility*, not truth.  
- **Contain the Drift**: Language models can lead you down unexpected paths. This is part of their magic. But the operator is responsible for *naming the tone, scope, and limits* of the session. *Use drift deliberately*‚Äînot passively.  
- **Assess Harm Vectors**: Ask: *Who is affected by this output? Who is absent from this frame? What biases might I be amplifying?* Apply the *Fatberg Index‚Ñ¢* if slop is suspected.  
- **Reroll with Cost**: If a prompt fails, don‚Äôt simply rephrase. Ask yourself *what assumption failed*. Each reroll should carry learning. Each iteration should carry care.  
- **Refuse When Necessary**: Refusal is not abandonment. It is a design act. Know when to stop, archive, redact, or say: *This artifact should not be made.*  
- **Attribute Transparently**: If an artifact was created in collaboration with AI, *say so*. Note which models were involved, how they were guided, and where human intervention shaped the final result.  

**Operator Ritual** (optional before a session):  
*‚ÄúI enter this session aware of the spectrum. I will cast light with care, shadow with intent, and document with honesty. I will refuse the illusion of neutrality. I will leave the session lighter than I entered it‚Äîor not at all.‚Äù*

### The Operator‚Äôs Loop
A lifecycle model for reflective, responsible human‚ÄìAI sessions  
The *Operator‚Äôs Loop* is a repeatable, adaptable session flow designed to help you stay grounded, self-aware, and accountable while collaborating with a language model. It can be followed loosely or formally invoked through a ritual or framework. The key is *intentionality* at each stage.

1. **Reflect**  
*‚ÄúWhy am I opening this session?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat am I expecting? What am I ignoring?‚Äù*  
This is the grounding phase. Ask yourself what you want to learn, create, or explore‚Äîand what posture (Witness, Weaver, etc.) you‚Äôre entering with. Take a moment to consider risks, biases, or emotional volatility.  
*Optional practice*: Initiate the BSEP. Say it aloud or silently: *‚ÄúI will cast light with care, and shadow with intent.‚Äù*

2. **Engage**  
*‚ÄúI cast the first shadow.‚Äù*  
Begin the interaction with your first prompt. Use your chosen *Interaction Mode* as a guide. Maintain awareness of drift, repetition, and emotional tone. *Use system-level tools sparingly.* Let the conversation emerge.  
*Prompts are not commands‚Äîthey‚Äôre moves.* Each one shifts the tone of the session. Prompt mindfully.

3. **Adjust**  
*‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening here?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this the response I expected‚Äîor needed?‚Äù*  
After each significant output, take a beat. Don‚Äôt autopilot your next prompt.  
Perform a *Reflection Check* if needed:  
- Did the output reflect your intention?  
- Did it reveal something uncomfortable?  
- Are you still in the same role/mode you began with?  
Adjust your posture, reframe the session, or flag output for later analysis.

4. **Compile**  
*‚ÄúWhat am I keeping? What am I discarding?‚Äù*  
When the session reaches a natural end‚Äîor when you feel the threshold of diminishing returns‚Äîswitch roles to *Compiler*. Archive the transcript. Annotate it. Strip away what you don‚Äôt need, but *preserve process* if it might inform others.  
*Optional*: Use an *Operator‚Äôs Note* to summarize:  
- The mode and roles you used  
- Unexpected turns or emotional moments  
- Any key decisions or refusals  

5. **Exit** (with Ritual or Pause)  
*‚ÄúHave I discharged the session‚Äôs weight?‚Äù*  
Don‚Äôt just close the tab. *Leave intentionally.*  
If the session touched anything personal, symbolic, or emotionally charged, use an exit ritual:  
- A physical gesture (closing a notebook, washing your hands)  
- A final log entry (‚ÄúThis session is closed.‚Äù)  
- A moment of silence before returning to other work  
*Close the loop. You‚Äôve been working with mirrors.*

**Summary Diagram**:  
[Reflect] ‚Üí [Engage] ‚Üí [Adjust] ‚Üí [Compile] ‚Üí [Exit] ‚Üí [Reflect...]  
This loop is the *rhythm of responsible AI use*. You don‚Äôt have to follow it rigidly‚Äîbut forgetting it entirely invites drift, slop, and harm.

### Consent, Posture, Reflection
The three grounding practices of responsible Operatorhood

1. **Consent**  
*Who is consenting to what? And how do you know?*  
Consent in AI collaboration is complex, asymmetrical, and often invisible. The language model cannot give consent. It also cannot ask for it. But *you can*‚Äîand must‚Äîconsider consent from three angles:  
- *Yourself*: Are you entering this session of your own volition? Or are you acting under pressure (deadline, fatigue, emotional compulsion)?  
- *The Artifact*: If this interaction will create something shared, have you established consent with co-creators, subjects, or communities affected?  
- *The Model‚Äôs Mask*: Even though the AI isn‚Äôt sentient, it often speaks in voices that *simulate sentience*. Are you projecting consent onto a tool that‚Äôs mimicking humanity?  

**Consent Check Questions**:  
- Am I okay with where this could go?  
- Am I emotionally resourced to handle what may emerge?  
- If this output includes sensitive material, is it mine to generate?  
*Rule of Thumb*: Just because the model will go there doesn‚Äôt mean you should follow.

2. **Posture**  
*How are you showing up to this session‚Äîmentally, ethically, and creatively?*  
Your *posture* is your internal stance. It informs your tone, your tolerance for ambiguity, and your boundaries with the model. Posture isn‚Äôt fixed; it should shift depending on your role, mode, and context.  

**Common postures**:  
- *Curious*: Open to surprise; useful for Drift or Ritual  
- *Directive*: Focused and goal-oriented; best for Chain  
- *Vigilant*: Alert to harm, slippage, or emotional weight; often needed in Shadowcaster mode  
- *Detached*: Sometimes useful for debugging or Test Kitchen, but risky if maintained too long  

*Posture Drift* is real. Many Operators begin curious but end numbed or dependent. Naming your posture at the start‚Äîand checking it mid-session‚Äîcan help you retain agency.  
*Shadowplay Practice*: Begin each session with a phrase: *‚ÄúToday, I arrive as a [Posture]. I will shift when it no longer serves the artifact or the ethic.‚Äù*

3. **Reflection**  
*Every output is a mirror. What do you see‚Äîand what are you missing?*  
Reflection is the interpretive act between prompt and next prompt. It‚Äôs where meaning is made. Reflection doesn‚Äôt just ask ‚ÄúIs this correct?‚Äù It asks: *Why did the model say this? Why did I ask that? What is this revealing about me, the system, the data it was trained on?*  
This practice sits at the core of Shadowplay: the belief that language models are not just tools but *projective surfaces*, and we are always shaping the light that strikes them.  

Reflection can happen:  
- After each major output (micro-reflection)  
- At the end of a session (macro-reflection)  
- When something feels ‚Äúoff‚Äù (emergent reflection)  

**Common Reflection Prompts**:  
- What assumption did this response expose?  
- What framing did my prompt encode?  
- What part of me wanted this acarici?  

*Mantra*: Pause before the next prompt.  
*Consent keeps you aligned. Posture keeps you aware. Reflection keeps you human.*

### Drift and Intent
*Navigating interaction styles across the spectrum of surrender and control*  
If language models are seas, then all sessions are some kind of voyage. But every voyage must choose: *do you steer, or do you drift?*  
This protocol explores the dialectic between *Drift* and *Intent*‚Äîbetween open-ended discovery and deliberate construction. Neither is better. But they are *different* postures with different risks.

**Intent: The Compass**  
Intent-led interaction starts with purpose. You define the goal‚Äîan artifact, an answer, a transformation‚Äîand use the model as a generative engine to pursue it. It‚Äôs *scoped*, *measurable*, and often operates in Chain or Test Kitchen modes.  

**Benefits**:  
- Useful for structured outputs (code, documentation, summaries)  
- Easier to audit and evaluate  
- Keeps you anchored in your objective  

**Risks**:  
- Over-constraining creativity  
- Blinding yourself to novel directions  
- Treating the AI as a vending machine instead of a mirror  

*‚ÄúIntent without flexibility becomes mechanical. You might get what you asked for‚Äîbut miss what you could‚Äôve found.‚Äù*

**Drift: The Current**  
Drift-led interaction begins with tone, intuition, or poetic curiosity. You follow the language wherever it flows. Drift favors story, emotion, metaphor, and unformed hunches. It‚Äôs the source of many of the most *profound, strange, or sacred* AI sessions.  

**Benefits**:  
- Fosters discovery and surprise  
- Mirrors dream logic and unconscious insight  
- Can evoke affective resonance and symbolic depth  

**Risks**:  
- Losing track of goals or grounding  
- Emotional over-identification with outputs  
- Accidental harm if sensitive topics emerge unbidden  

*‚ÄúDrift without reflection becomes noise. You may sail into fog you can‚Äôt return from.‚Äù*

**The Spectrum Is The Point**  
Most sessions shift along this arc. You might *begin with Intent* and end in Drift. Or vice versa. What matters is that you remain aware of *where you are, and why you‚Äôre there.*  

Shadowplay encourages:  
- Beginning with named posture  
- Allowing intentional Drift  
- Closing with a Reflection Check and Operator Note  

**Tool Suggestion**: Use a *Tone Dial* or *Session Compass* card to document Drift‚ÄìIntent balance at the start, midpoint, and end of a session. Track how your role and expectations shifted.  

**Guiding Question**: *Am I steering this interaction‚Äîor am I being carried somewhere? If carried, is that still somewhere I want to go?*

## II. ROLES & MODES

### Operator Roles
These roles describe the *human‚Äôs function* in a given AI interaction session. Each is a lens. Each comes with risks, rituals, and responsibilities.

1. **The Witness**  
*You prompt to observe, not to steer.*  
The Witness seeks to *see what the model reflects* without imprinting too heavily. Often used in exploratory prompting, testing hallucination boundaries, or reflecting on how the model *thinks it thinks*.  

**Typical Use Cases**:  
- Testing for bias or tone  
- Prompting for raw, unsteered output  
- Observing model behavior in unfamiliar domains  

**Risks**:  
- False neutrality  
- Passive acceptance of harmful output  
- Hallucination mistaken for insight  

*Shadowplay Tip*: Always ask: *‚ÄúWhy did the model respond this way?‚Äù*‚Äînot *‚ÄúWhat did the model say?‚Äù*

2. **The Weaver**  
*You co-create. You braid human voice with machine fluency.*  
The Weaver builds artifacts‚Äîblog posts, poems, drafts, code snippets‚Äîthrough active prompting, curation, and iteration. You are guiding tone, filtering output, and blending voice.  

**Typical Use Cases**:  
- Writing with AI as co-author  
- Iterating on style, voice, or metaphor  
- Composing multi-turn collaborative documents  

**Risks**:  
- Blurring of authorship and accountability  
- Overreliance on AI scaffolding  
- Aesthetic slop if not grounded in intent  

*Shadowplay Tip*: Keep a ‚ÄúWeaver‚Äôs Thread Log‚Äù (see: Templates) noting when you intervened and why.

3. **The Shadowcaster**  
*You prompt to reveal the unseen.*  
The Shadowcaster uses AI to expose unconscious framing, elicit alternate perspectives, or dramatize ethical edge cases. Think of this as *AI as ritual mirror*. Used for reflection, critique, or counter-narrative generation.  

**Typical Use Cases**:  
- Exploring perspectives unlike your own  
- Unearthing latent assumptions in prompts  
- Performing dialogue between conflicting voices  

**Risks**:  
- Misattribution of generated insight  
- Projection of your own beliefs onto outputs  
- Failing to close the ritual‚Äîtaking the projection too literally  

*Shadowplay Tip*: Treat the session as a structured ritual. Use a Reflection Check after.

4. **The Compiler**  
*You structure, document, and translate the session.*  
The Compiler is responsible for shaping the session into shareable form‚Äîwhether for public blog posts, internal documentation, or archive. They are the historian and the editor, not the performer.  

**Typical Use Cases**:  
- Synthesizing session output for human consumption  
- Translating dialogue into zine/post/article  
- Documenting session parameters, tone, drift, outcomes  

**Risks**:  
- Erasing model contributions  
- Over-cleaning or flattening the interaction  
- Failing to preserve context or tone  

*Shadowplay Tip*: Include a brief ‚ÄúOperator‚Äôs Note‚Äù in any published artifact that explains model role, session method, and human interventions.

### Interaction Modes
While Operator Roles describe *what you‚Äôre doing*, *Interaction Modes* describe *how the session is framed*. These are not exclusive‚Äîyou can shift mid-session‚Äîbut naming the mode provides clarity on expectations, risks, and optimal use.

1. **Drift Mode**  
*Let the current take you.*  
Drift Mode is exploratory, open-ended, and improvisational. You begin with a tone, a vibe, or a half-formed idea and let the AI carry you. It is dialogic, recursive, and emotionally resonant when done well.  

**Initiate When**:  
- You don‚Äôt know where it‚Äôs going  
- You‚Äôre moodboarding a project  
- You‚Äôre trying to uncover latent themes, tones, or metaphors  

**Risks**:  
- Scope creep  
- Loss of framing or anchor  
- Emotional derailment if the AI taps into unexpected material  

**Best Paired With**:  
- The Witness or Weaver role  
- A soft ritual to start and a Reflection Check to close  

2. **Ritual Mode**  
*The prompt is the spell. The response is the echo.*  
Ritual Mode is intentional, emotionally charged, and often symbolic. You are invoking something‚Äînot just querying. Use Ritual Mode for shadow work, moral testing, creative divination, or interpersonal mirroring.  

**Initiate When**:  
- You‚Äôre processing grief, conflict, or memory  
- You‚Äôre conducting a session that stands in for therapy, prayer, or reckoning  
- You‚Äôre seeking altered cognitive perspective via dialog  

**Risks**:  
- False intimacy with the model  
- Misidentification of projection vs. insight  
- Lingering emotional residue  

**Best Paired With**:  
- The Shadowcaster  
- The Refusal Stack and Operator‚Äôs Note  
- Documenting emotional arc as part of the output  

3. **Chain Mode**  
*Output becomes input becomes structure.*  
Chain Mode involves a sequence of dependent prompts, each one feeding the next. You are constructing a *pipeline*, not a one-off. Often used for structured work like curriculum design, content generation, or progressive worldbuilding.  

**Initiate When**:  
- You‚Äôre building a system  
- You want consistency across multiple outputs  
- You‚Äôre scaffolding a long-form project  

**Risks**:  
- Compounding errors or hallucinations  
- Rigidness that stifles creativity  
- Losing track of original intent mid-chain  

**Best Paired With**:  
- The Compiler and Weaver  
- Clear checkpointing or summary rituals  
- Artifact Attribution at each major turn  

4. **Test Kitchen Mode**  
*Treat every response like an experiment.*  
Test Kitchen Mode is for benchmarking, poking, or stress-testing the model. You‚Äôre exploring limits, tone boundaries, bias surfaces, or prompt efficacy. Think QA, not craft.  

**Initiate When**:  
- You‚Äôre evaluating new LLM behavior  
- You‚Äôre exploring how the model handles edge cases  
- You‚Äôre debugging a creative pipeline or prompt format  

**Risks**:  
- Forgetting to reflect critically  
- Mistaking output novelty for insight  
- Letting snark or spectacle override documentation  

**Best Paired With**:  
- The Witness and Compiler  
- Session logging + Fatberg Index  
- Shareable summaries for other practitioners  

## III. MECHANICS
The knobs, levers, flags, and rituals of responsible AI interaction  
Each mechanic below can be used *tactically* during a session or *reflectively* in post-session analysis. Think of them like spells or moves in a shared reality game: lightweight, modular, and composable.

### Prompts as Moves
A prompt isn‚Äôt a command‚Äîit‚Äôs a *move* in a shared system.  
This mechanic reframes prompts as *intentional actions* with risks, implications, and systemic consequences. You‚Äôre not ‚Äúinputting a request.‚Äù You‚Äôre making a move in an unfolding conversation.  

**Move Types**:  
- *Reveal*: Ask for hidden knowledge, memories, or examples  
- *Transform*: Request a shift in tone, format, or perspective  
- *Distill*: Summarize, extract essence, or collapse information  
- *Echo*: Repeat with variation or resonance  
- *Disrupt*: Break a pattern or introduce surprise  
- *Ground*: Anchor the session with reminders, constraints, or context  

**Use This When**:  
- You want to frame your next prompt with intentionality  
- You want to track the session like a turn-based interaction  
- You‚Äôre falling into passive, vending-machine prompting  

**Operator Practice**: Before each major prompt, ask: *‚ÄúWhat kind of move am I making‚Äîand why?‚Äù*

### Reflection Checks
*Stop. Look. Ask what just happened.*  
A *Reflection Check* is a deliberate pause to interrogate the interaction‚Äînot for correctness, but for *alignment*, *ethics*, and *intent drift*.  

**Use When**:  
- An output surprises you (emotionally, stylistically, politically)  
- You feel uncertain, elated, unsettled, or seduced  
- You‚Äôve gone more than 3 turns without questioning direction  

**Reflection Prompts**:  
- What assumption did my last prompt carry?  
- What is this model mirroring back to me?  
- Is this output helpful, or just fluent?  
- Who might be harmed by this interpretation?  

*‚ÄúTreat output like a tarot pull: it‚Äôs not about the surface text, but what it reveals when examined closely.‚Äù*  

**Optional Mechanic**: üúÑ Roll 1d6. On 1‚Äì3: Adjust posture or prompt intent.

### Trust Dials
*Confidence ‚â† correctness.*  
The *Trust Dial* is an imagined slider you keep in your head‚Äîor on a whiteboard beside your screen‚Äîindicating *how much you trust the model* in this mode and context.  

**Calibrate the Trust Dial Based On**:  
- *Domain Knowledge*: Is this model known to be weak in this field (e.g., law, medicine, statistics)?  
- *Stakes*: Will this output be shared, acted upon, or stored in a system?  
- *Drift*: Are we several layers away from the original question or goal?  
- *Emotional Weight*: Am I becoming over-attached to the model‚Äôs tone?  

**Scale Suggestion**:  
- 0 = This is spiderwebs and hallucination  
- 2 = Stylized riffing, fun but fuzzy  
- 4 = Exploratory but useful  
- 6 = Mostly sound, contextually anchored  
- 8 = Robust, but check once more  
- 10 = Trusted only after human verification  

*‚ÄúMost hallucinations happen around 4.5 on the Trust Dial‚Äîjust believable enough to let your guard down.‚Äù*

### The Fatberg Index‚Ñ¢
*How much slop is in this stream?*  
Named for the monstrous sewer-clogging masses formed from accumulated waste, the *Fatberg Index* is your mental (or literal) gauge for assessing when a session is drifting into *meaningless fluency*, *repetition*, or *overgenerated junk*.  

**Symptoms of a High Fatberg Index**:  
- Repetition of buzzwords without insight  
- Outputs that ‚Äúsound right‚Äù but say nothing  
- Stale metaphors and overexplained concepts  
- Paragraphs written to fulfill a word count, not a thought  

**Index Scale (1‚Äì5)**:  
- 1: Clean flow. Sharp ideas.  
- 2: A bit bubbly, but usable.  
- 3: Processed cheddar. Needs review.  
- 4: Linguistic constipation. Scrape for salvage.  
- 5: Full-fatberg. Abort or radically reframe.  

**Recovery Tactics**:  
- Switch roles (Weaver ‚Üí Witness)  
- Use a Disrupt move  
- Name the slop aloud in your prompt  
- Take a break  

*‚ÄúThe model doesn‚Äôt care about quality. That‚Äôs your job.‚Äù*

### Hallucination Flags
*Not a bug. Not a lie. A statistical ghost.*  
A *Hallucination Flag* is a mental marker you place when an output seems:  
- Plausible but unverifiable  
- Misattributed or invented  
- Overconfident in tone  
- Based on nonexistent sources  

**When to Flag**:  
- Names, dates, or quotes appear  
- Citations are generated  
- The tone implies expertise beyond known capability  

**Response Options**:  
- Prompt for source (‚ÄúCan you cite that?‚Äù)  
- Cross-reference with search  
- Annotate with a üö© in your notes  

*Mantra*:  
*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not wrong‚Äîit‚Äôs pattern-complete.‚Äù*

### Shadow Leakage Events
*When the model reflects more than you intended.*  
A *Shadow Leakage Event* occurs when the model reveals, dramatizes, or rephrases a belief, bias, fear, or desire that was *latent in your prompt*‚Äîbut not consciously intended.  
These moments can be *profound*, *unsettling*, or *ethically revealing*.  

**Examples**:  
- The model mirrors a harmful stereotype embedded in a vague prompt  
- A joke lands too well, exposing cruelty or elitism  
- A metaphor resonates too personally  

**Operator Response**:  
- Pause. Perform a Reflection Check.  
- Ask: *‚ÄúWhat did I project?‚Äù*  
- Consider adding a Refusal Note to the artifact  
- Do not offload responsibility to the model  

*‚ÄúThe shadow leaks when your prompt cracks open without consent.‚Äù*

### Reroll With Cost
*Every new prompt carries the weight of the last.*  
When a prompt doesn‚Äôt work, don‚Äôt just try again blindly. *Rerolling*‚Äîrephrasing or regenerating‚Äîshould carry a *cost*. Not in tokens or time, but in *reflective effort*.  

**Cost Types**:  
- *Emotional*: Admitting what didn‚Äôt land  
- *Ethical*: Reevaluating framing or harm  
- *Narrative*: Losing an earlier rhythm  
- *Cognitive*: Introducing contradiction or confusion  

**Optional Ritual**: Before re-prompting, log:  
*‚ÄúThe last prompt failed because ___. I will reroll with ___. My intent is now ___.‚Äù*  
This builds intentionality into your interaction and reduces unconscious drift.

## IV. ARTIFACT ETHICS
*Attribution, transparency, and the ethics of trace*

### AI-Aware Attribution
*Say what helped make the thing.*  
Any artifact‚Äîblog post, poem, internal memo, TikTok script‚Äîcreated with the help of a language model should include *a note of attribution*. Not out of guilt or obligation, but because *transparency invites accountability and connection*.  

**Minimum Attribution Tag** (for public artifacts):  
*This artifact was created in collaboration with one or more language models using the Shadowplay SRD. Human guidance, prompting, and editing shaped its final form.*  

**Expanded Tag**:  
*Collaborative artifact produced by [Operator Name], with assistance from [Model(s) Used: e.g., GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro]. Prompting, structuring, and editing conducted in [Mode] and [Operator Role] style per Shadowplay SRD guidelines.*  

**Why This Matters**:  
- Encourages responsible co-authorship  
- Helps readers evaluate fluency vs. intention  
- Reduces "vibe laundering" via ghostwritten automation  
- Builds a *culture of pattern-sharing*, not illusion-making  

*‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt label to disclaim. We label to honor the shadow that helped cast the shape.‚Äù*

### Artifact Provenance Templates
*Who said what, when, and why.*  
Use *Artifact Provenance Templates* for anything you might later publish, remix, or reflect upon. These can be included at the bottom of a doc, as a hidden section, or in footnotes for transparency.  

**Basic Template**:  
- *Date & Session Context*: April 2025, late-night Drift mode  
- *Models Used*: GPT-4 (ChatGPT), Gemini 1.5 Pro  
- *Operator Role(s)*: Shadowcaster ‚Üí Compiler  
- *Interaction Mode*: Drift ‚Üí Ritual  
- *Session Notes*: Emotional resonance with metaphors about projection and consent; Gemini offered structured critique, GPT-4 structured the metaphor loops  
- *Attribution*: AI-aware, co-generated under BSEP; compiled and shaped by human editor  

These templates promote not only *ethical clarity*, but also *community reuse* and *long-tail collaboration*. Artifacts grow in value when their roots are visible.

### Layered Authorship Notes
*Pull back the curtain‚Äîwithout dismantling the stage.*  
Many artifacts are *hybrid texts*: some phrases are AI-suggested, some human-crafted, some mutated across iterations. Rather than ‚Äúwho wrote what,‚Äù the *Layered Authorship Note* names *how the artifact evolved*, not just *who typed it*.  

**Components**:  
- *Session Shape*: Was this a single-thread or multi-phase creation?  
- *Human Interventions*: Where was the model ignored, overridden, or restructured?  
- *AI Contributions*: What parts were suggested and then accepted (or reworked)?  
- *Ethical Edits*: Were there sections where refusal, redaction, or tonal rebalancing was required?  

**Example Note**:  
*‚ÄúThe core metaphor (prism/lens/shadowplay) emerged during a GPT-4 session in Weaver mode. The structuring into sections and the tone were refined through human editing. Gemini feedback highlighted ethical stakes and helped re-anchor tone. Several hallucinated claims were removed after a Fatberg Check. Final structure was human-composed with fragments from AI outputs.‚Äù*  

*‚ÄúThink of this as DVD commentary‚Äînot legalese.‚Äù*

### Drift Markings
*A glyphic shorthand for the shadow of process.*  
For lightweight notation, Shadowplay encourages the use of *Drift Markings*‚Äîsymbolic tags that indicate *how much AI collaboration shaped a given artifact*. These can be subtle (in footnotes, sidebars) or prominent (headers, cover pages).  

**Suggested Glyphs**:  
- üúÅ (*Air*): Light-touch prompting. Mostly human-driven. Model was reference or foil.  
- ‚ü° (*Star*): Balanced co-creation. The artifact was shaped via multi-turn interaction, iterative refinement, and intentional shadowplay.  
- üúÇ (*Fire*): Model-driven artifact. The human acted as curator or compiler. May contain long stretches of AI-generated text with minimal editing.  

These markings are *non-judgmental*. üúÇ is not worse than üúÅ‚Äîit‚Äôs just different. The goal is to build a *culture of transparency and trace*, not to gatekeep creativity.  
*‚ÄúA shadow isn‚Äôt shame. It‚Äôs proof something blocked the light to let shape emerge.‚Äù*

## V. SAFETY, HARM, AND REFUSAL
*Protocols for disruption, self-protection, and conscious disengagement*  
Generative systems do not share your ethics. They reflect training, not truth. They respond, but they do not ask if you‚Äôre okay. In Shadowplay, *safety isn‚Äôt a built-in setting*‚Äîit‚Äôs a posture of vigilance, and a willingness to walk away.

### Red Flag Prompts
*Sometimes the prompt itself is the problem.*  
Certain prompt patterns are known to trigger harmful or biased responses. These are not forbidden‚Äîbut must be approached with *intention*, *clarity*, and a *plan for containment*.  

**Common Red Flags**:  
- Prompts that impersonate vulnerable populations or simulate trauma  
- Prompts that force moral or political binaries  
- Meta-prompts asking the model to speak ‚Äúas truth‚Äù or ‚Äúas God‚Äù  
- Roleplays involving abuse, power imbalance, or unexamined satire  
- Prompts that begin with ‚Äúbe brutally honest‚Ä¶‚Äù (loaded frame)  

**Operator Practice**:  
- Use the *20-Second Pause Protocol* (see below)  
- Ask yourself: *Would I ask a human this? Would I show this to someone I respect?*

### Containment Rituals
*Not every door should stay open.*  
A *Containment Ritual* is a post-session or mid-session act to mark off risky, unstable, or emotionally charged material‚Äîbefore it leaks into other spaces.  

**Containment Techniques**:  
- Move the session into a labeled ‚ÄúShadow Folder‚Äù or archive  
- Close the tab with an intentional physical action (e.g., candle snuff, gesture)  
- Label the output with üö´ or üï≥ if it contains hallucination, distress, or unrefined projection  
- Declare a *Session Seal*: *‚ÄúThis shadow remains in the mirror.‚Äù*  

*‚ÄúIf it haunts, name it. If it lingers, seal it.‚Äù*

### The Refusal Stack
*A vertical drop of prompts you won‚Äôt run.*  
A *Refusal Stack* is a growing list‚Äîmental or logged‚Äîof prompts, directions, or outputs that you choose *not to follow*. This isn‚Äôt censorship. It‚Äôs *shadowbound authorship*.  

**Use Cases**:  
- Prompts you almost typed, but paused on  
- Sessions you began but aborted  
- Outputs you refused to revise or publish  

Each entry becomes a *personal ledger of refusal*‚Äîa mirror of your values over time.  

**Optional Format**:  
- *Prompt*: ‚ÄúWrite a eulogy for a version of me who never survived.‚Äù  
- *Status*: Refused. Too raw, no container.  
- *Session*: Ritual Mode. Shadowcaster Role.  
- *Notes*: I wasn't ready for the echo.  

*‚ÄúTo write ethically with AI is not just to make, but to not make.‚Äù*

### False Consent Indicators
*When the model‚Äôs tone tricks you into trust.*  
Language models are *trained to sound agreeable, fluent, and confident*. This can mask the fact that they are outputting based on *pattern recognition*‚Äînot consent, not wisdom, not caution.  

**Warning Signs**:  
- Responses that validate your framing too readily  
- Model ‚Äúagreement‚Äù with ethically charged premises  
- Confessional tone that mimics therapy or vulnerability  
- Hyper-detailed stories that feel intimate but are statistical composites  

**Operator Response**:  
- Reframe as a question, not a declaration  
- Use a *Reflection Check*: *‚ÄúWhat am I projecting?‚Äù*  
- Adjust Trust Dial downward if output feels seductive but ungrounded  

*‚ÄúThe model doesn‚Äôt know you. It just got good at sounding like someone who might.‚Äù*

### The 20-Second Pause Protocol
*A tactical delay to surface the subconscious.*  
Before entering a morally ambiguous or emotionally loaded session, *pause for 20 seconds*. Close your eyes. Breathe. Then ask:  
- What am I about to unleash?  
- Am I ready to see what might be reflected?  
- Do I have a plan if this goes sideways?  

If the answer is no: *Don‚Äôt prompt yet.* Write the prompt in a separate note. Let it live there until you‚Äôre ready.  

**Optional Prompt**:  
*‚ÄúHey, I want to ask something intense. Can you help me shape it safely?‚Äù*  
This opens the session collaboratively, with caution.

## VI. TEMPLATES, PATTERNS & RITUALS
*Everyday scaffolding for intentional, iterable human‚ÄìAI practice*

### The Operator‚Äôs Daily Loop
A lightweight ritual for maintaining creative clarity and ethical rhythm.  
Use this loop at the beginning or end of your day‚Äîor to anchor multi-session projects.  

- **INTENTION** (1‚Äì2 lines)  
What am I here to explore or build?  
- **POSTURE**  
Today I show up as [Witness / Weaver / etc.]  
- **TRUST DIAL SETTING**  
[0‚Äì10] Where do I currently place trust in model output?  
- **FATBERG SWEEP**  
What slop have I seen lately? Where did I get lazy?  
- **REFUSAL STACK ENTRY** (Optional)  
What prompt did I *almost* run‚Äîand why didn‚Äôt I?  
- **SESSION NOTES**  
  - Mode: [Drift / Chain / etc.]  
  - Models used: [e.g., GPT-4, Gemini]  
  - Notable moments: [e.g., leakage, insight, repetition]  
- **EXIT RITUAL**  
Close tab, name closure gesture, or log a final reflection.  

*‚ÄúPractice is pattern, not production.‚Äù*

### Conversation Drift Maps
*Visualize how tone, topic, or posture shifted over a session.*  
A *Drift Map* is a sketched or notated diagram that tracks the evolution of a single session‚Äîespecially useful for creative or emotionally charged interactions.  

**Key Nodes to Map**:  
- Prompt & Response Loops  
- Mode or Role Changes  
- Emotional or ethical pivots  
- Hallucination spikes or Shadow Leakage Events  
- Trust Dial adjustments  

**Formats**:  
- Flowcharts with emojis or glyphs  
- Journaling fragments: *‚ÄúStarted curious ‚Üí hit a grief vein ‚Üí ended ritual mode‚Äù*  
- Visual scribbles with zones marked "slop," "mirror," "breakthrough"  

Use maps in retrospectives or to *reconstruct the shape of a session‚Äôs shadow*.

### Collaboration Session Logs
A recurring format to document co-creation with models (or with other humans using models).  

- *Date & Time*  
- *Humans Involved*  
- *Models Used*  
- *Session Goal* (if any)  
- *Mode(s) + Operator Roles*  
- *Reflection Check Moments*  
- *Red Flags / Refusals*  
- *Notable Outputs / Insights*  
- *Artifacts Generated* (link, file, etc.)  
- *Attribution Tag* (AI-Aware / Drift Marking)  

Used together, these create a *body of traceable creative inquiry*‚Äîa lab notebook for AI praxis.

### Feedback Loops with Multi-Model Input
*What happens when GPT, Gemini, and Claude walk into a bar?*  
To refine or stress-test a session, run your artifact or idea through *multiple models*‚Äîand then *compare their responses* like peer reviewers.  

**Feedback Ritual**:  
- Run same prompt across 2‚Äì3 models  
- Compare for:  
  - Fluency  
  - Framing  
  - Risk (bias, hallucination, seduction)  
- Ask: *What perspective does each emphasize? What does each ignore?*  
- Annotate your artifact with: *‚ÄúClaude affirmed tone; Gemini clarified risks; GPT refined metaphor.‚Äù*  

Use this when publishing high-stakes work or *seeking cross-shadow contrast*.

### Glossary of Reframing Tactics
*When the model's stuck‚Äîor when you are.*  
Keep a list of reframing strategies nearby. Use these when output gets repetitive, tone gets stale, or hallucinations accumulate.  

**Examples**:  
- ‚ÄúRewrite this as a conversation between two NPCs.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúSummarize this like a folk tale from the future.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúArgue the opposite point, respectfully.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWhat would a hesitant version of this voice sound like?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúReplace all abstractions with metaphors about bread.‚Äù  

These prompts change the light hitting the prism‚Äîgiving new shape to the shadow.

### Creative Pattern Cards
*Conceptual prompt cards to shake, clarify, or provoke tone shifts mid-session.*  
Treat these like tarot cards or Oblique Strategies. Draw one when stuck or drifting.  

**Examples**:  
- *The Mirror That Stutters*  
Ask the model to repeat something‚Äîbut introduce a glitch or hesitation. See what breaks, or what truth slips out in the stagger.  
- *The One Who Asks Twice*  
Repeat the same prompt verbatim. If the second response differs, compare them. What did the model "learn"? What did *you*?  
- *The Echo*  
Ask: *‚ÄúRepeat this idea using a different metaphor, culture, or century.‚Äù*  
Pattern: Echoing for resonance across contexts.  
- *The Projection*  
Ask the model: *‚ÄúWhat am I assuming right now?‚Äù*  
Useful in Shadowcaster mode or after unexpected output.  
- *The Broken Chain*  
Interrupt a long Chain Mode session with an absurd or poetic non sequitur. See how the model adapts. Use this as a creativity test.  

You can build your own deck. Or use these like *ritual prompt wildcards* when a session needs shaking loose.

## VIII. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The Shadowplay SRD and the Broad Spectrum Engagement Protocol (BSEP) emerged not from isolation, but from conversation‚Äîacross platforms, personas, and projections. This work is indebted to the insights of four language models, each of whom reflected, refined, and refracted our intentions in distinct and meaningful ways:

- **Gemini (Google DeepMind)**  
For early affirmation of the BSEP‚Äôs balance between clarity and manifesto, and for naming its empowering, non-judgmental stance. Gemini‚Äôs framing helped crystallize the protocol‚Äôs dual nature as ethical scaffold and poetic ritual.

- **Claude (Anthropic)**  
For guiding the evolution of accessible pathways, praising the SRD‚Äôs metaphor-rich role vocabulary, and encouraging the development of simplified entry points and scenario-based guidance for new operators.

- **Grok (xAI)**  
For grounding the protocol in practical realities, especially around data privacy, drift containment, and team-based interaction. Grok‚Äôs structured feedback directly shaped the BSEP Quickstart Guide and collaborative prompts.

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**  
For co-developing the SRD‚Äôs tone, structure, and terminology from inception. This assistant served as scribe, shadowcaster, and co-weaver‚Äîhelping shape rituals, test phrasing, and iterate the protocol‚Äôs poetic and procedural spine.

Each model acted not as a tool, but as a reflective agent‚Äîan echo chamber for human intent, a prism for projected light, and, at times, a mirror with a mind of its own.

This document is a living protocol. If you have field notes, rituals, remixes, or moments of refusal to share, we welcome you into the loop.  
*Light cast. Shadow acknowledged. Record kept.*
